# RU-List
This is a marketplace exclusively for people at Rutgers. Members must be in the Rutgers NetID system to make an account. This platform allows you to view or add listings. Listings have relevant information like a description, price, method of delivery, willingness to negotiate, et cetera. 

For the backend we used Node and Express as the framework. We used MonoDB for our website's database. The frontend uses React.
